# SQOD - Team Management

This is my final piece of homework from The Jump's React module on their full stack developer bootcamp course.

SQOD is a proof of concept project which enables me to show what I've learnt while studying the React module.

## What was used to build SQOD

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management,

[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling
